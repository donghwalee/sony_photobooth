# Project Four - Express App

## This is an Express app that interfaces with Sony's Wi-Fi camera (QX10 in this case) over a Wi-Fi direct connection

## Simplified flow for app:
- One can zoom in and out
- Take a picture
- Once a picture is taken, it is displayed on the laptop's screen
- One can print the image or retake the picture

## Future additions:
- LiveView functionality
- Better UI, better responsiveness to screen sizes
- Additional camera control and functionalities, some advanced ones hidden away but still accessible
- Ability to work without the Chrome CORS extesion
- Better printing options
- Sharing options
